        We are a small group of volunteers from Silicon Valley, California. During the recent Covid wave in India, we saw a lot of well intentioned good samaritans send cash or kind to India. However in many of these cases there was wastage due to duplication of efforts, delay in aid reaching the right person or just lack of funds. This portal is a small attempt in connecting genuine need with the right sources.
